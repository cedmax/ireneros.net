[I](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/irenegk) started studying theatre at the University of Bologna, but during the first year, attending the course “Creativity and Indipendence in Performing Arts” by Pontedera Foundation, I discovered that Bologna was not the centre of the world.

That’s why I left for Holstebro (DK): I wanted to get inspired by Odin Teatret. After a stoge dinner, I dreamt about Hansel e Gretel’s witch house and I produced my first performance for children as Ursa Maior* (co-operating with Teatro Ridotto di Lavino di Mezzo - BO).

I kept choosing my Masters and I ended up in Lithuania, where I observed Eimuntas Nekrošius’s work and wrote my degrees thesis: “L’Attualità della polvere: Cechov nel teatro di Nekrošius” (The actuality of dust: Cechov in Nekrošius’ theatre).

Back from Lithuania, I produced my first two performance for adults.

In 2007 I got pregnant - since no-one takes you seriously in Italy if you’re less than 40, it’s better to start a family soon - and I made two important choices: I quit being a mercenary actress to dedicate myself to my very projects and I ceased being the hard director of myself to become the dictatorial director of someone else.

Hormonally hyperactive, I wrote a project for a startup and won a young enterprise funding contest made by the Bologna District. When the original project (a design/communication office) was deflected to be a radical-chic shop by my colleagues, I realized it was time to stop and give birth to my first son.

During the summer of 2011, while feeding my second son, the performance ‘Rosa’s Dream’ saw the light. Rosa’s Dream is what I consider my milestone: my bar was raised to a new standard.

That’s why in the Autumn of 2011 ‘That Blue light’, a piece on the life of Madame Curie, got a lifting. In March 2012, postponed due to snow storm, ‘The snow queen-I don’t need you’ made its debut.

In 2012 I started to work on 'Marcel', with the urge to find connections between theatre and the contemporary world I'm living in. Marcel has been performed at the Brighton Fringe in 2013 and in the Edinburgh Fringe in 2014.
