[I](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/irenegk) started to study theatre in Bologna University in the XX century (impressive, isn't it?). After a few months I had already left Bologna to attend and acting workshop in Pontedera. After all, Bologna was not the centre of the world.

That’s why I left for Holstebro (DK) to get inspired by Odin Teatret. After a heavy dinner, I dreamt about Hansel e Gretel’s witch house and I produced my first show for children.

In summer 2002 I saw 'The Seagull' in the Venice Biennale and I fell in love. Two years later I finally landed in Lithuania, to observe Eimuntas Nekrošius’ work. Clearly my degrees thesis was about them: “L’Attualità della polvere: Cechov nel teatro di Nekrošius” (The actuality of dust: Cechov in Nekrošius’ theatre). Back from Lithuania, I produced my first two performance for adults.

In 2007 I had my first son, I realised that we were inseparable and I decided to quit acting to dedicate myself to my own projects as a director. 

During summer of 2011, while feeding my second son, ‘Rosa’s Dream’ saw the light. 

In March 2012, postponed due to a snow storm, ‘The snow queen-I don’t need you’ premiered. In the same year I started to work on 'Marcel', with the urge to find connections between theatre and the contemporary world we're living in. 

Since I had moved to London during the Olympics, 'Marcel vol. I - Italian politics as a work of art' was staged in the Brighton Fringe in 2013 and in the Edinburgh Fringe in 2014.

In 2016 'Marcel vol.II - Point de fuite Vanishing Point' premiered in Rich Mix. Oh yes, it's about politics again.
