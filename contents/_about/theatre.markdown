Theatre broke into the window when I was 14 and it always came back in from there when I tried to kick it out from the door.

I graduated in Semiotics of performance in the University of Bologna.

When I was 6 I held my first camera and since then Iâ€™ve never ceased to look at the world as a frames set.
