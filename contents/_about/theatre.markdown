Theatre broke into the window when I was 14 and it always came back in from there when I tried to kick it out from the door.

I graduated in Semiotc of performance in the University of Bologna.

In my work I pursue the research of Balance as ethical and esthetical principle.

When I was 6 I held my first camera and since then Iâ€™ve never ceased to look at the world as a frames set.

Direction is my way to interpret texts/themes.
