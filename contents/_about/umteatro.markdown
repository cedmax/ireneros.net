[Ursa Maior](http://umteatro.it) is a professional theatre group I've created in 2002 to weave new languages and new forms of expression, to experiment new relations between space, words and body.

Over the years I've led it, Ursa Maior projects have been supported by the National Agency of the European Union, the Committee for Equal Opportunities of Padua University, Fondazione del Monte di Bologna e Ravenna, Rosa Luxemburg Foundation of Berlin, Women Centre of Bologna, Bologna Bookfair for children, Italian Cultural Institute of London.
