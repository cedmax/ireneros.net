When I was 3 I wanted to become a forester, when I was 11 an architect, at 14 I wanted to attend political science or become an actress.  
I became a vegetarian, aesthete, politically aware theatre director and multimedia artist.   
I live in London with my two kids (a 10 year-old  boy with a big passion for numbers and a 7 year-old anarchist) and [their dad](https://cedmax.com).
