When I was 3 I wanted to become a forester, when I was 11 an architect, at 14 I wanted to attend political science or become an actress.  
I became a vegetarian, animal-activist, aesthete, political lined up director, fascinated by everything is communication.  
I live in London with my two kids - a 6 yo boy with a big passion for numbers and a 3 yo anarchist - and their dad.
