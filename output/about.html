			<h4>In brief</h4>
			<p>When I was 3 I wanted to become a forester, when I was 11 an architect, at 14 I wanted to attend political science or become an actress.</p>
<p>I became a vegetarian, animal-activist, aesthete, political lined up director, fascinated by everything is communication.  </p>
<p>I live in London with my two kids - a 6 yo boy with a big passion for numbers and a 3 yo anarchist - and their dad.</p>

			<h4>Theatre</h4>
			<p>Theatre broke into the window when I was 14 and it always came back in from there when I tried to kick it out from the door.</p>
<p>I graduated in Semiotc of performance in the University of Bologna.</p>
<p>In my work I pursue the research of Balance as ethical and esthetical principle.</p>
<p>When I was 6 I held my first camera and since then I’ve never ceased to look at the world as a frames set.</p>
<p>Direction is my way to interpret texts/themes.</p>

		<h4>Curriculum Vitae</h4>
		<p><a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/irenegk">I</a> started studying theatre at the University of Bologna, but during the first year, attending the course “Creativity and Indipendence in Performing Arts” by Pontedera Foundation, I discovered that Bologna was not the center of the world.</p>
<p>That’s why I left for Holstebro (DK): I wanted to get inspired by Odin Teatret. 
After a stoge dinner, I dreamt about Hansel e Gretel’s witch house and I produced my first performance for children as Ursa Maior<a href="#note">*</a> (co-operating with Teatro Ridotto di Lavino di Mezzo - BO).</p>
<p>I kept choosing my Masters and I ended up in Lithuania, where I observed Eimuntas Nekrošius’s work and wrote my degrees thesis: “L’Attualità della polvere: Cechov nel teatro di Nekrošius” (The actuality of dust: Cechov in Nekrošius’ theatre).</p>
<p>Back from Lithuania, I produced my first two performance for adults.</p>
<p>In 2007 I got pregnant - since no-one takes you seriously in Italy if you’re less than 40, it’s better to start a family soon - and I made two important choices: I quit being a mercenary actress to dedicate myself to my very projects and I ceased being the hard director of myself to become the dictatorial director of someone else.</p>
<p>Hormonally hyperactive, I wrote a project for a startup and won a young enterprise funding contest made by the Bologna District. 
When the original project (a design/communication office) was deflected to be a radical-chic shop by my colleagues, I realized it was time to stop and give birth to my first son.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2011, while feeding my second son, the performance ‘Rosa’s Dream’ saw the light.
Rosa’s Dream is what I consider my milestone: my bar was raised to a new standard.</p>
<p>That’s why in the Autumn of 2011 ‘That Blue light’, a piece on the life of Madame Curie, got a lifting.
In March 2012, postponed due to snow storm, ‘The snow queen-I don’t need you’ made its debut.</p>
<p><a name="note">*</a> <a href="http://umteatro.it">Ursa Maior</a> projects have been supported in the years by the National Agency of the European Union, the Committee for Equal Opportunities of Padua University, Fondazione del Monte di Bologna e Ravenna, Coop Adriatica, Rosa Luxemburg Foundation of Berlino, Women Centre of Bologna, Bologna Bookfair for children.</p>
