				<h4>Theatre</h4>
				<p>Theatre broke into the window when I was 14 and it always came back in from there when I tried to kick it out from the door.</p>
<p>I graduated in Semiotics of performance in the University of Bologna.</p>
<p>When I was 6 I held my first camera and since then I’ve never ceased to look at the world as a frames set.</p>


				<h4>Ursa Maior Teatro</h4>
				<p><a href="http://umteatro.it">Ursa Maior</a> is a professional theatre group I&#39;ve created in 2002 to weave new languages and new forms of expression, to experiment new relations between space, words and body.</p>
<p>Over the years I&#39;ve led it, Ursa Maior projects have been supported by the National Agency of the European Union, the Committee for Equal Opportunities of Padua University, Fondazione del Monte di Bologna e Ravenna, Rosa Luxemburg Foundation of Berlin, Women Centre of Bologna, Bologna Bookfair for children, Italian Cultural Institute of London.</p>

			<h4>Biography</h4>
			<p><a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/irenegk">I</a> started to study theatre in Bologna University in the XX century (impressive, isn&#39;t it?). After a few months I had already left Bologna to attend an acting workshop in Pontedera. After all, Bologna was not the centre of the world.</p>
<p>That’s why I left for Holstebro (DK) to get inspired by Odin Teatret. After a heavy dinner, I dreamt about Hansel e Gretel’s witch house and I produced my first show for children.</p>
<p>In summer 2002 I saw &#39;The Seagull&#39; in the Venice Biennale and I fell in love. Two years later I finally landed in Lithuania, to observe Eimuntas Nekrošius’ work. Clearly my degrees thesis was about them: “L’Attualità della polvere: Cechov nel teatro di Nekrošius” (The actuality of dust: Cechov in Nekrošius’ theatre). Back from Lithuania, I produced my first two performance for adults.</p>
<p>In 2007 I had my first son, I realised that we were inseparable and I decided to quit acting to dedicate myself to my own projects as a director. </p>
<p>During summer of 2011, while feeding my second son, ‘Rosa’s Dream’ saw the light. </p>
<p>In March 2012, postponed due to a snow storm, ‘The snow queen-I don’t need you’ premiered. In the same year I started to work on &#39;Marcel&#39;, with the urge to find connections between theatre and the contemporary world we&#39;re living in. </p>
<p>Since I had moved to London during the Olympics, &#39;Marcel vol. I - Italian politics as a work of art&#39; was staged in the Brighton Fringe in 2013 and in the Edinburgh Fringe in 2014.</p>
<p>In 2016 &#39;Marcel vol.II - Point de fuite Vanishing Point&#39; premiered in Rich Mix. Oh yes, it&#39;s about politics again.</p>


      <h4>CutMoose</h4>
			<p><a href="http://cutmoose.com">Cut Moose</a> is a new collaboration founded by puppeteer Helen Ainsworth and myself. The collaboration is dedicated to creating thought provoking theatre that is visually stimulating, essentially entertaining and often surreal. </p>
